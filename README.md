## Resources-used

* <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer" target="_blank">I spent some time exploring the Inquirer Docs.</a> 

* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Kr9OSfDeU" target="_blank">I need to explore the far away worlds of async and await to accomplish my tasks.</a>

## Possible-improvements

An improvement for the future would be the layout of the employee cards. The padding and margins could look more professional.

It would be helpful to the user if there was some validation checks for prompts. For instance, what if they accidentally hit "Enter" without adding an input?
